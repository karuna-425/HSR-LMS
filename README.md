*LEAD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM*
*Date: 19/12/2024*
OVERVIEW
HSR Motors, a car dealership, was facing challenges managing their leads using spreadsheets. Their goal was to develop a more efficient system where the sales team could easily track and qualify leads in real-time. The system should also provide the business manager with a quick overview of the leads received from various platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Google, the website, and offline events. The problem with the existing system was its lack of real-time collaboration and data management.
Approach:
The solution was to design a web application that could replace the existing manual spreadsheet system with a more user-friendly and functional application. The application allows the Sales Team to manage and qualify leads efficiently, while the Business Manager can quickly view insights into the leads through an organized dashboard.
The web application includes:
Lead Listing: A screen where all incoming leads are displayed.
Lead Details: A screen to view detailed information about each lead.
Lead Management: A screen where the sales team can update and manage lead statuses.
Dashboard: A screen that provides a visual summary and analytics of the leads.
